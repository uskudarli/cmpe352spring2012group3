# Introduction #

I am a senior student in Boğaziçi University CMPE department. I am attending several more courses besides from CMPE352 and work as half time employee in a company.

I love my department, and love to work in this area.

In my spare times, I mostly watch movies, play OKEY with my frinds, go fitness in Hisar Campus, or simply go outside for drinking. I am also a member of BUHAK where we schedule some daily trips in weekends.

In case if anyone wants to connect me, my mail is cigdem.kocberber@gmail.com
